    Hello everyone, My name is Sunghoon. <br>Do you like to travel?
    <p>There are so many different purposes and forms of travel. 
    I would like to tell you about one of the most impressive travels in my life. 
    that is a walking tour. </p>

    At that time, I quit my job for a long time and was in despair.
    Then, at the recommendation of a friend, I went on a walking tour 
    from Seoul to Namwon. I walked a huge distance of 40km every day,
    but the beautiful sunset of the Han River, the sea of Daecheon, 
    and the autumn colors of jirisan didnâ€™t make me tired. 
    I am a bold person so even on a cold autumn day, 
    I entered the sea of Daecheon or climbed the 
    Jirisan using mountain path instead of a hiking trail. 
    At that time Surely the landowner said there was a way,
    but he was a liar. The day was going down and we were 
    lost in the mountains It was a huge crisis, but I went 
    down the mountain with Google Maps. Google maps showed all the roads. 
    I was a little afraid but jirisan was a wonderful mountain with the best autumn colors. 
    Not only these experiences, but most importantly, I was able to think 
    a lot and organize myself while walking. Until then, for me, travel was just a fun experience, 
    good food and relaxing. But it was a trip that gave me the strength to rise again. 
    It's a walking tour.
